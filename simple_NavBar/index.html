Angular has directives.
In this case they are set and read the active variable
class="{{active}}

The  HTML is updated atutomatically if it uses the same class.

In Angular's terminology, this variable is called a model. It is available to all directives in the current scope, and can be accessed in your controllers (more on that in the next example).

 {{var}} syntax. When the framework sees such a string, it replaces it with the contents of the variable. This operation is repeated every time var is changed.
